# Coffee And Madness - now with AJAX
Ia! Ia! Let's get some coffee.

What if the coffee thing talked to an API server instead of talking to localStorage

There are bears here, because AJAX is hard to use. I have to pretend my data is immediate, and its hard to wrap your head around.

The other big problem is that I can't use most of my old code, so here we go updating things.

# It works!

It took a little bit to get the logic together. I wanted to "wipe the board" every time we draw the orders at the bottom, instead of just erasing one item. I wonder what the overhead of doing it that way is, versus just erasing a single one. I hear React like to wipe the slate clean too. Hmm.
